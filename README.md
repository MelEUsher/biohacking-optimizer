# 🧬 Biohacking Personal Optimization Predictor

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model that predicts personalized biohacking recommendations based on individual lifestyle data inputs (sleep patterns, workout intensity, supplement intake, screen time, etc.).  
It follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach: writing tests first, then building the functionality to pass those tests.

---

## Project Goals
- Predict supplement regimens and habit optimizations based on user data.
- Visualize the relationships between health behaviors and biohacking goals.
- Build the project using a **Test-Driven Development** workflow to ensure reliability, maintainability, and professional-grade code quality.
- (Stretch Goal) Deploy an interactive Streamlit dashboard for user inputs and predictions.

---

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn
- **Testing Framework:** PyTest
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **(Optional Front-End):** Streamlit

## Test-Driven Development Workflow
- Define expected behavior for each function or module.
- Write unit tests inside `/tests/`.
- Write the actual code to pass those tests.
- Refactor while keeping all tests green.
- Run full test suite regularly using:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

---

## Dataset(s)
- [ ] Public health/lifestyle datasets (Kaggle, UCI ML Repo, PhysioNet)
- [ ] Optional: Personal health tracking data (exported from devices or medical logs).
