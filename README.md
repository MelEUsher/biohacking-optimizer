## Overview

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts personalized biohacking recommendations based on individual lifestyle data inputs (sleep patterns, workout intensity, supplement intake, screen time, etc.).  
It follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach: writing tests first, then building the functionality to pass those tests.

---

## Project Goals

- Predict supplement regimens and habit optimizations based on user data.
- Visualize the relationships between health behaviors and biohacking goals.
- Build the project using a **Test-Driven Development** workflow to ensure reliability, maintainability, and professional-grade code quality.
- Deploy an interactive Streamlit dashboard for user inputs and predictions.

---

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn
- **Testing Framework:** PyTest
- **Formatting Tool:** Black (auto-formatting Python code to PEP8 standards)
- **Linting Tool:** Ruff (fast Python linter and code quality checker)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **(Front-End):** Streamlit
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Containerization:** Docker (for deployment)

---

## Code Quality and Style

This project follows professional Python code quality standards:

- **Formatting:** [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used to automatically format all `.py` files.
- **Linting:** [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is used for ultra-fast linting and code quality checking.

### How to Format Code

Format all Python files in the project automatically:

```bash
black .
```

### How to Lint Code

Check all Python files for code quality issues:

```bash
ruff check .
```

Automatically fix certain linting issues:

```bash
ruff check . --fix
```

## All code should pass both Black formatting and Ruff linting before being committed.

```

---

## Test-Driven Development Workflow

- Define expected behavior for each function or module.
- Write unit tests inside `/tests/`.
- Write the actual code to pass those tests.
- Refactor while keeping all tests green.
- Run full test suite regularly using:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

---

## Dataset(s)

- [ ] Public health/lifestyle datasets (Kaggle, UCI ML Repo, PhysioNet)
- [ ] Potential: Personal health tracking data (exported from devices or medical logs).

---

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/biohacking-optimizer.git
cd biohacking-optimizer
```

### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### 5. Running the Streamlit App (Potential for Later)

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```
